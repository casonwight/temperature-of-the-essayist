Actual Output:  prayers. Like anger. Like love.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.1):  a ball, or flat like the surface of a plate, we see that the emptying is not finished. It is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.2):  a ball, we hold them in one hand, holding them with the other. Then we take our fingers off them and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.3):  a ball, or flat like the surface of a plate. Some are small, some are large. They are all different
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.4):  a ball, or shaped like the letter P, we let them go.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.5):  a ball, they are holding the empty space we feel. They are our hearts, which hold the rest of ourselves,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.6):  the corkscrew, pointed like a hammer, like my hand, we make our own shapes. We're making

Predicted Output (w/temp 1.0999999999999999):  cords, standoffs from us as we move. In our eyes, they're nothing but shapes, made of fabric
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.2):  a snake, curled with a sense of tension and tension against every fiber of cloth; they are so distinct and so
