Prompt: In our deplaning, I try to shake away the insecurities, tucking bits of them into the seatback pocket and leaving trails of them along the narrow path towards the coolness of the Oregon afternoon. I’m careful to avoid my hips brushing the seats even if they are unoccupied. But ahead I see her with the meat of her hips swaying against the leather and I want to ask her how to reverse the shrinking and become as open as
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actual Output:  the wide blue sky.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.1):  she can be.

The last time we saw each other, in our last
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.2):  the rest of herself.

The next day, when we board the plane again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.3):  the rest of herself.

The next day, after a long flight, when
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.4):  the sky. Even though I don’t want her feeling uncomfortable, my heart is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.5):  the rest of herself.

The next few hours are filled with questions and answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.6):  the little spaces in her back. Her face is still a blank, her
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.7):  she can be, as free as her legs are. After a few minutes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.7999999999999999):  they were and yet still be as small as she can be.
As I
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.8999999999999999):  she can be, like the grass beside her. Yet I don’t know where
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 0.9999999999999999):  possible. All the way home, while I’m still holding on to my jeans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.0999999999999999):  the rest of you and yet shrink in spite of all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.2):  possible. Some are soaked and some have come off like Ives on
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.3):  her legs allow or maybe even tighter. I’ll tell her I don’t
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.4):  that fat who just so happened for this flight. Perhaps that person just fell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.5):  possible, let alone how easy can one be in these conditions to jump up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.5999999999999999):  this. Her blonde lashes smile broadly upon those behind us but without
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.7):  everyone is without my waistline holding it back.

Once I do finally feel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.8):  possible or make any fleshy bits that will hide the gap and let
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 1.9):  Mary Lou Brynmountain as she becomes through her skin.

“God
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicted Output (w/temp 2.0):  an apx and look nice. Once, however, after five years trying
